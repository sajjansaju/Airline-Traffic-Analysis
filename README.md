# ✈️ International Airlines SQL Analysis 
## (currently working on this project)

## 🧩 Problem Statement

As a Data Analyst working with a national aviation board, your mission is to analyze international air traffic trends between Australian cities and global destinations using historical flight data (2003–2020). The goal is to extract actionable insights that can help stakeholders understand international route performance, airline seat capacity, city-level contributions, and travel patterns across time, stops, and regions.

This project will showcase your SQL skills in answering real-world business questions using a wide range of SQL functions such as data filtering, time extraction, grouping, aggregation, conditional logic, and ranking.
