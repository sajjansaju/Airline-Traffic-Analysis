# ‚úàÔ∏è International Airlines SQL Analysis 


## üß© Problem Statement

As a Data Analyst working with a national aviation board, your mission is to analyze international air traffic trends between Australian cities and global destinations using historical flight data (2003‚Äì2020). The goal is to extract actionable insights that can help stakeholders understand international route performance, airline seat capacity, city-level contributions, and travel patterns across time, stops, and regions.

The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle:  
**[Australian Flight Dataset (2003‚Äì2022) ‚Äì by Gaurav Pandey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pandeyg0811/australian-flight-dataset-2003-2022)**


## üéØ Project Objectives

**1.Explore Time-Based Trends**
- Identify peak travel months and years.

**2.Rank Top Airlines by Traffic and Capacity**
- Find airlines with the highest flights and seat capacity.
- Analyze the top airline performance trends over time.

**3.Understand Route-Level Performance**
- Identify top-performing international routes by flight volume.
- Find least-served routes.
- Analyze the number of direct flights on each route.

**4.Compare Inbound vs Outbound Patterns**
- Identify cities with a major outbound or inbound bias.
- Visualize direction-based trends.

**5.Regional and Country-Level Analysis**
- Rank regions and countries based on total flights and seat count.
- Track growth in travel from Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, etc.

**6.Flight Stop Analysis**
- Analyze flight capacity and counts based on number of stops.
- Compare direct vs. connecting routes in terms of performance.

**7.Australian City-Level Insights**
- Find cities with the most international connections.
- Track yearly growth of outbound flights for each city.
- Rank cities by route diversity.


## üìå Findings & Conclusion

After conducting a detailed analysis of international air traffic patterns across Australian cities using two decades of flight data. This project uncovered valuable insights to inform aviation strategy, resource allocation, and market development.

### üîç Key Findings

- **Peak Travel Periods**: December consistently recorded the highest international flight volumes, suggesting that holiday seasons drive peak demand. The years **2018 and 2019** marked the industry's operational peak before the **COVID-19** disruption.

- **Airline & Route Dominance**: **Qantas Airways** led both in flight frequency and seat capacity, while **Sydney-Auckland** was the most active international route, reflecting strong travel ties with **New Zealand and Southeast Asia**.

- **Inbound vs. Outbound Balance**: Australian cities displayed **balanced inbound and outbound volumes** over time, affirming Australia's stable role in global travel corridors.

- **Regional & Country Trends**: **Southeast Asia** emerged as the top contributing region for flights, followed by **New Zealand** and **Northeast Asia**. Countries like **Singapore**, **Indonesia**, and the **USA** are key international partners.

- **Efficiency & Preferences**: **Direct flights** significantly outperformed connecting routes in both usage and efficiency, emphasizing travelers' preference for faster, non-stop travel options.

- **City-Level Insights**: **Sydney**, **Melbourne**, and **Brisbane** are Australia‚Äôs global aviation hubs, offering the most connections and highest route diversity. In contrast, smaller cities had limited international reach but showed occasional spikes.

### üß† Conclusion

This analysis not only highlighted key performance areas of Australia's international aviation landscape but also demonstrated how **structured SQL analysis** can translate raw data into **actionable business insights**. These insights support strategic decisions in **airline route planning**, **airport resource management**, and **international partnership development**. As travel continues to rebound post-pandemic, **data-driven forecasting and planning** will be crucial to ensuring sustainable growth in the sector.

group by flight_route
order by Total_flights desc
limit 3;
```

**6)Find least-served routes.**
```sql
select route as flight_route,
sum(all_flights) as Total_flights
from airlines
group by flight_route
order by Total_flights asc
limit 3;
```

**7)Analyze the number of direct flights on each route.**
```sql
select route as flight_route,
sum(all_flights) as Total_direct_flights
from airlines
